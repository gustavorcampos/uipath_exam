Advanced Data Manipulation - Doing
• Use LINQ for Lists and DataTables.  
• Perform DateTime manipulation to parse dates, add or substract time and convert to and 
from string type. 
• Use Invoke Method and Invoke Code in projects. 
• JSON object manipulation 

Debugging 
• Perform remote Debugging when building automation projects. 
• Profile execution - debugging 
                                                                                
Advanced UI Automation 
• Use AI Computer Vision features in projects (CV only automation) 
• Build an UI Automation using Web Driver.  
• Remote runtime
 
Advanced Control Flow 
• Describe the components of State Machines and when they should be used in projects. 
• Build projects using State Machines. 
 
REFramework 
• Explain the use of the REFramework and the Dispatcher and Performer / Producer and 
Consumer model. 
• Describe the mechanisms of the REFramework template.  
• Use Custom Log Fields in REFramework projects.  
• Build a REFramework project with Orchestrator queues. 
• Build a REFramework transactional project with tabular/collections data. 
• Adapt a REFramework project to a linear process. 
• Test a REFramework project with and without Orchestrator queues.
  
Orchestrator 
• Use Tenant Entities (Webhooks, Alerts, Packages, etc) and Folder Entities (Triggers, 
Credential Stores, etc). 
• Use features for unattended automations (use of folders and job priorities, separation 
between background and foreground processes, license allocation per machine). 
• API Triggers 
• Recording in Orchestrator (Queue tranx, jobs) 
• Solutions Management 
• Use Orchestrator monitoring features. 
• Serverless and Cloud VM robots 
• Tags 

Attended Automation 
• Long Running Workflows 
• Trigger-based Automation 
• UI Automation Apps Native Events Triggers (Run local triggers, Stop local triggers) 
• Event Inspection Tool 
• Assistant (widgets, configuration, marketplace, schedules) 
• Picture in Picture 

Other advanced concepts
